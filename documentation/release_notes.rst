Release 2.0.0
=============

**New Features**
    - New CMake build flags: NO_LIB, NO_CUDA, NO_PYTHON)

**Changes**
    - OpenSubdiv is now under Apache 2.0 license
    - HbrHalfedge and HbrFVarData copy constructors are now private
    - Documentation style matched to graphics.pixar.com + new content
    - Add an animation freeze button to ptexViewer
    - Variable name changes for better readability across all example
      shader code

**Bug Fixes**

    - Fix incorrect patch generation for patches with 2 non-consecutive boundary edges
    - Fix "undefined gl_PrimitiveID" shader build errors
    - Fix for shader macro "OSD_DISPLACEMENT_CALLBACK"
    - Fix out-of-bounds std::vector access in FarPatchTablesFactory

----

Release 1.2.4
=============

**New Features**

    - Adding support for fractional tessellation of patches
    - Adding a much needed API documention system based on Docutils RST markup
    - Adding support for face-varying interpolation in GLSL APIs
    - Adding varying data buffers to OsdMesh
    - Adding accessors to the vertex buffers in OsdGlMesh
    - Adding face-varying data to regression shapes

**Changes**

    - Cleanup of common bicubic patch shader code (GLSL / HLSL) for portability 
      (ATI / OSX drivers)
  
**Bug Fixes**

    - Fix FarVertexEditTablesFactory to insert properly vertex edit batches
      (fixes incorrect hierarchical hole in regression shape)
    - Fix FarPatchMap quadtree to not drop top-level non-quad faces
    - Fix Gregory patches bug with incorrect max-valence
    - Fix FarPatchTables::GetNumFaces() and FarPatchTables::GetFaceVertices()
      functions to return the correct values
    - Fix face indexing GLSL code (ptex works on non-quads again)
    - Fix face-varying data splicing in FarMultiMeshFactory
    - Fix ptex face indexing in FarMultiMeshFactory
    - Fix glew #include to not break builds
    - Fix Clang / ICC build failures with FarPatchTables 
    - Fix build and example code to work with GFLW 3.0+
    - Fix cmake to have ptex dynamically linked in OSX

----

Release 1.2.3
=============

**New Features**

    - Adding Varying and Face-Varying data interpolation to EvalLimit

**Changes**

    - EvalLimit API refactor : the EvalContext now has dedicated structs to track all
      the vertex, varying and face-varying data streams. Also renamed some "buffers"
      into "tables" to maintain code consistency
    - EvalLimit optimization : switch serial indexing to a quad-tree based search

**Bug Fixes**

    - Face-varying data bug fixes : making sure the data is carried around appropriately
      Fixes for OpenCL use with the new batching APIs
    - GLSL general shader code cleanup & fixes for better portability
    - GLSL Tranform Feedback initialization fix
    - Critical fix for FarMultiMesh batching (indexing was incorrect)
    - Fix osdutil CL implementation (protect #includes on systems with no OpenCL SDK
      installed)
    - Fix face-varying interpolation on adaptive patches
    - FarPatchTables : fix IsFeatureAdaptive() to return the correct answer
    - Fix Far factories to handle the absence of face-varying data correctly.
    - Many GLSL shader code style fixes which should help with ATI / OSX shader compiling

Release 1.2.2
=============

**New Features**

    - Introducing the EvalLimit API : the Eval module aims at providing support for
      computational tasks that are not related to drawing the surfaces. The EvalLimit
      sub-module provides an API that enables client code to evaluate primitive variables
      on the limit surface.

    - Osd<xxx>ComputeController : minor optimization. Added early exit to Refine method 
      to avoid unnecessary interop. 

**Changes**

    - OsdGLDawContext : minor API change. Protecting some member variables and adding
      const accessors
    - OsdError : minor API refactor, added Warning functions.

**Bug Fixes**

    - Fix Ptex bug : prevent corner texel guttering code to from going into infinite 
      loops
    - Adding the ability for a FarMeshFactory to construct patchTables starting from 
      'firstLevel' in uniform subdivision mode
    - Consolidating the color coding of bicubic patch types through all our our code 
      examples (this is used mostly as a debugging tool)
    - Fixing some MSVC++ build warnings
    - Update to the outdated README.md

----
