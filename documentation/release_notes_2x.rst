Release 2.4.1
=============

**Changes**
    - Add correct OpenSubdiv namespace begin/end blocks.

**Bug Fixes**
    - Compile osdutil with -fPIC for correct linking.
    - Fix a bug of OsdUtilMeshBatch, the varying buffer isn't computed with CL kernels
    - Fix FindGLFW.cmake to use the %GLFW_LOCATION% environment variable in Windows
    - Fix Draw contexts do not fully initialize patch arrays

Release 2.4.0
=============

**New Features**
    - Adding functionality to store uniform face-varying data across multiple levels of subdivision
    - Add OsdUtilPatchPartitioner.
      It splits patcharray into subsets so that clients can draw partial surfaces
      for both adaptive and uniform.

**Changes**
    - Remove FarMesh dependency from Osd*Context.
    - Use DSA APIs for GL buffer update (if available).
    - Refactor Far API
    - replace void- of all kernel applications with CONTEXT template parameter.
      It eliminates many static_casts from void- for both far and osd classes.
    - move the big switch-cases of far default kernel launches out of Refine so
      that osd controllers can arbitrary mix default kernels and custom kernels.
    - change FarKernelBatch::kernelType from enum to int, clients can add
      custom kernel types.
    - remove a back-pointer to farmesh from subdivision table.
    - untemplate all subdivision table classes and template their compute methods
      instead. Those methods take a typed vertex storage.
    - remove an unused argument FarMesh from the constructor of subdivision
      table factories.
    - Refactor FarSubdivisionTables.
      Delete scheme specialized subdivision tables. The base class FarSubdivisionTables
      already has all tables, so we just need scheme enum to identify which scheme
      the subdivision tables belong to. This brings a lot of code cleanups around far
      factory classes.
    - Move FarMultiMeshFactory to OsdUtil.
    - Move table splicing functions of FarMultiMeshFactory into factories
    - Change PxOsdUtil prefix to final OsdUtil prefix.
