#     including the license conditions and limitations in section 3,
#     each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide,

#     its contribution or any derivative works that you create.
#     (B) Patent Grant- Subject to the terms of this license,
#     including the license conditions and limitations in section 3,

#     (B) If you bring a patent claim against any contributor over
#     patents that you claim are infringed by the software, your
#     patent license from such contributor to the software ends
#     automatically.
#     (C) If you distribute any portion of the software, you must
#     retain all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution
#     notices that are present in the software.

#     complete copy of this license with your distribution. If you
#     distribute any portion of the software in compiled or object
#     code form, you may only do so under a license that complies
#     with this license.
#     (E) The software is licensed "as-is." You bear the risk of
#     using it. The contributors give no express warranties,
#     guarantees or conditions. You may have additional consumer
#     rights under your local laws which this license cannot change.
