    ///  A PatchTable can be constructed from a TopologyRefiner that has been
    ///  either adaptively or uniformly refined.  In both cases, the resulting
    ///  patches reference vertices in the various refined levels by index,
    ///  and those indices accumulate with the levels in different ways.
    ///
    ///  For adaptively refined patches, patches are defined at different levels,
    ///  including the base level, so the indices of patch vertices include
    ///  vertices from all levels.
    ///
    ///  For uniformly refined patches, all patches are completely defined within
    ///  the last level.  There is often no use for intermediate levels and they
    ///  can usually be ignored.  Indices of patch vertices might therefore be
    ///  expected to be defined solely within the last level.  While this is true
    ///  for face-varying patches, for historical reasons it is not the case for
    ///  vertex and varying patches.  Indices for vertex and varying patches include
    ///  the base level in addition to the last level while indices for face-varying
    ///  patches include only the last level.
